Description: The United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
    administers Medicare Advantage (MA) health insurance plans. MA plan capitation
    rate depends on risk adjustment factor of the covered population. The risk
    adjustment factor is calculated by using a hierarchical condition category (HCC)
    risk adjuster. This algorithm takes a combination of demographic and disease
    state variables to assign the member a level of chronic illness burden.
